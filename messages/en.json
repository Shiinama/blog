        "content": "- You build things (or want to): apps, tools, scripts, services\n- You are curious whether AI is useful in the real world, not just in hype or papers\n- You care about software and business together: pricing, funnels, retention—not just clean code\n- You like peeking behind the curtain: failed launches, messy dashboards, real trade-offs\n\nThe vibe I want:\n- Less “thought leader,” more fellow builder leaving you long voice notes\n- Less polished essays, more honest breakdowns, experiments, and failures\n- Normal to talk about what worked, what was wasted effort, and what we will change next\n\nI hope it becomes a small, nerdy, high-signal community of people who ship, share, and help each other avoid obvious cliffs."
